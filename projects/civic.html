    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I haven‚Äôt yet taken part in a civic engagement project, but it‚Äôs something I truly want to explore.  
        As a future engineer, I believe we all have a responsibility to use our skills for the common good - 
        whether it‚Äôs helping others access technology, 
        raising awareness about environmental issues, or supporting local communities.

    <h2>What Matters to Me</h2>

        <h3>Protecting the Oceans</h3>
        <p>
          As a scuba diving enthusiast, I‚Äôve seen how fragile marine ecosystems can be.  
          I‚Äôd love to join associations dedicated to cleaning coastal areas or preserving underwater biodiversity.  
          The ocean is a place I deeply care about, and contributing to its protection feels meaningful to me.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Internet Safety & Cyber Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          With the rapid growth of online activity, I think it‚Äôs 
          essential to promote good practices regarding cybersecurity 
          and data privacy. I‚Äôd like to contribute to projects that teach 
          people how to stay safe online, protect their personal information, 
          and understand digital risks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Future Involvement</h3>
        <p>
          Even small actions can make a difference - supporting school initiatives, 
          participating in environmental events, or promoting responsible tech use.  
          I hope to take part in such projects during my studies or through professional opportunities abroad.
