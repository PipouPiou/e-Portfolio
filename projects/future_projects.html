    <h2>What I‚Äôd Like to Do</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt have a single path set in stone yet. But I know that whatever I do, 
        I want it to be <strong>creative, challenging, and meaningful</strong>.  
        Here are a few directions that inspire me today.

        <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst</h3>
        <p>
          The idea of defending systems, finding vulnerabilities, and 
          solving complex problems feels like a digital version of board games ‚Äî 
          strategy, anticipation, and logic.  
          I‚Äôd love to work in a field where curiosity and precision really matter.

        <h3>Game Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I grew up fascinated by game design and storytelling.  
          Building interactive worlds where people can think, explore, 
          and feel emotions sounds like a perfect mix of art and technology.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          I also enjoy designing robust systems ‚Äî from user-friendly apps to backend 
          architectures. Developing useful tools or platforms that make 
          people‚Äôs lives easier gives real purpose to my coding skills.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Research & Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm curious about how technology evolves, especially artificial intelligence 
          and how it can help humans make smarter decisions.  
          Working on innovative projects in that field could be a long-term goal.
